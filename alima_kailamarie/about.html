                    <p>"I had the pleasure of working with Kaila Marie on our 
                        recent exercise. Her dedication, creativity, and 
                        commitment to excellence were truly impressive. She 
                        consistently went above and beyond to ensure our 
                        exercise success, and I couldn't have asked for a 
                        better group mate. I look forward to working with 
                        her again in the future." - Cruz Simounne</p>

            <h2>Me after 5 years</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 20px;">As I sit down 
                to reflect on the person I will become in five years, I am 
                filled with a sense of wonder and excitement. On a personal 
                level, the person I will be in five years is shaped by the 
                lessons learned and challenges overcome. I see myself 
                evolving, not just in age but in wisdom and resilience.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;"> </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 20px;">The glimpses of 
                the industry that I've encountered, despite the stress and 
                pressure that accompanied them, have been invaluable in 
                shaping my perspective. The challenges were not roadblocks but 
                stepping stones, pushing me to stretch my capabilities and 
                discover reservoirs of resilience within myself. Each 
                sleepless night, every tight deadline, and the weight of 
                responsibility have been investments in a future that I am 
                passionate about. </p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;"> </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 20px;">As I reflect on 
                the past few months and brace myself for the upcoming weeks, I 
                recognize that the journey has not been easy, nor will it be. 
                However, the question of whether it's worth it is met with a 
                resounding "yes." The stress and pressure have been catalysts 
                for growth, shaping my resilience and determination. The 
                industry I'm entering, with its demands and fast pace, fuels 
                my desire to excel and evolve. I still want to be here because 
                it's not just a job; it's a journey of learning, innovation, 
                and personal fulfillment.</p>
            <h3>My Goals</h3>
            <p>Aspirations that drive me forward:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Achieve success in life</li>
                <li>Make my parents proud of what I can become in the 
                    future</li>
                <li>Maintain a healthy diet</li>
                <li>Improve my sleep quality</li>
                <li>Excel academically and get good grades</li>
